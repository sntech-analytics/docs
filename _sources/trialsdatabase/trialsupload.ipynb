    "# Pisces trial database upload\n",
    "\n",
    "## This document describes the steps required to upload the Pisces trial data to MariaDB\n",
    "\n",
    "In the preceding step we screened and pre-processed the raw data for upload. Here, we actually add records to the database. A line-by-line form is of no use - we have to bulk upload records. But first, we need to actually make a database to upload to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pisces trial database structure\n",
    "To generate the database from scratch, we use SQL rather than any sort of graphical interface. It is easier to spot mistakes, and if we screw something up it's easier at this early stage to simply re-run everything and start again. First we need to log in via a terminal to the server and start MariaDB. The user of course needs to have write permissions. These were established when I set up MariaDB in the server chapter.  \n",
    "**Note**:  \n",
    "- We use the -p option to prompt for a password. It's the only way to get in\n",
    "- SQL statements are finished with a semicolon\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ssh craig@77.68.125.129\n",
    ">craigspassword\n",
    "\n",
    "mariadb -p\n",
    "Enter password: craigspassword\n",
    "```\n",
    "This brings up the MariaDB prompt. The approach I take is to have the SQL code in a text file, and copy-paste segments into the terminal step by step. Be careful is you are using a Windows text editor because it may use stupid Windows-specific characters for line or carriage returns.  \n",

    "So far so good. MariaDB has generated a database schema and structure, and set up directories for where the tables will live. Don't be tempted to manually alter or define these. MariaDB will manage (effectively) unlimited numbers of databases, but it needs to keep track of everything internally. It is best to let it do its own organising.  \n",
    "Of course we only need to make the database once. Oce it's there, we need to populate it with data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Transferring data to the server\n",
    "To get data to the server I use Filezilla, which is a graphical FTP interface. The database files live in:   \n",
    "/home/sntech/PiscesTrialDatabase  \n",
    "Within this directory there is a Data folder, which holds the csv files for upload, and folders for both the original and the renamed versions of the photos. Needless to say, you will need write permissions for this directory. \n",

    "```{warning}\n",
    "I can't stress how important it is to be careful when moving files to and from the server - particularly when you have extended write permissions. A lot of damage can be done within a very short period of time on a unix server!\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "Now the files are on the server, we can again use some SQL code to upload them to the database. The exact code will depend on which tables you are uploading to. Also, in the example below I've just specified some generic file names.\n",

    "A few explanatory notes...  \n",
    "- The SET GLOBAL local_infile=1; statement is required because by default MySQL 8.0 doesn't allow infile upload. This is a security thing.\n",
    "- LOAD DATA LOCAL enables the local filesystem to be read. If you drop the LOCAL option, you will receive a relatively uninformative message about permissions and tear your hair out trying to figure what's wrong.\n",
    "- IGNORE INTO TABLE is a rather odd syntax, but this prevents upload of duplicates. Each entry in the processed file has either a primary key (unique) value, or a combination of values that will be unique to a given sample. IGNORE INTO scans for and will not upload duplicates on the INFILE. This prevents you adding two lines for the same data point\n",
    "- IGNORE 1 ROWS drops the header from the CSV.\n",
    "- For Eilidh Anne there is separate effort table, because we can only identify daily effort, not hours per haul.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all has gone according to plan, everything is in the database. You can check individual tables by (for example):\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT * FROM trialID;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Or if you want to do a visual check, see the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An alternative...\n",
    "It is possible to use a GUI interface to upload data. This is occasionally useful if you have to upload from a local file, however I prefer to keep the master file(s) saved on the server so things can be reconstructed *de novo* if required.  \n",
    "The recommended GUI is phpMyAdmin. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} PhpMyAdminScreenshot2.png\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally I use phpMyAdmin just as a visual check that nothing stupid has crept in.  \n",
    "\n",
    "That completes the Pisces Trial database read-in procedure."
