<p>According to the SNT web page itâs all very simple. We put <em>Pisces</em> on a net. It repels fish we donât want, attracts fish we <em>do</em> want - mission accomplished!</p>
<p>If only it were that straightforwardâ¦</p>
<p>Letâs have a closer look at the science behind testing whether <em>Pisces</em> is a viable Bycatch Reduction Device, and worth the cost for industry to adopt. As a device, Pisces is very simple. It generates different light colours, with different flash frequencies. We know fish perceive and respond to light. The challenge is to use this behaviour in a way that enables the fish to interact with the gear in such a way that their catch rates are reduced/increased as required.</p>
<p>From a trials perspective, the challenge is to find the gear set up that will achieve this, and the unequivocally test the light vs non-light set up.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>It is tempting to consider the testing of effects such as Light/Non-light as a statistical issue. However the key is developing a setup that actually alters the environment you want to change in the way you intend it to, and to apply this change and compare to a <em>Control</em> state. This is about experimental design, not statistics. If an experimental design is critically flawed, no amount of statistics will save it.<br />
However, sometimes our experimental design will not be perfect. As long as the core is sound, we can use statistical methods to salvage weaker problems with the implementation of the protocol.</p>
</div>
<div class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"></p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>As this stage we are going to assume that fish see and respond to light in some way. We can bypass issues like wavelength and so on for the moment. For now, letâs get the logic of the testing process together,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Letâs start from the broad scale and work our way down. If we get it wrong at the most fundamental stage, then we are wasting time, money, goodwill, and credibility.</p>
<div class="section" id="confounding-what-it-is-and-how-to-avoid-it">
<h3>Confounding. What it is, and how to avoid it.<a class="headerlink" href="#confounding-what-it-is-and-how-to-avoid-it" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>In its simplest form, all we are doing is comparing fish catches <strong>with</strong> <em>Pisces</em> to fish catches <strong>without</strong> <em>Pisces</em>. Herein lies the problem. We canât re-run time on exactly the same sample unit to see what the catch would have been with, and without the light. We have to compare the light treatment to a <strong>Control</strong>. But how do we ensure that the <em>only</em> thing that differed between treatment and control was the light itself?</p>
</div>
<p>Consider a trial in which we have a single vessel, towing a single net. How do we test whether there are differences between Treatment and Control?  A naive approach might be to deploy Pisces at the start, do three tows with and three tows without Pisces, and see what the difference is.</p>
<p>What is the problem with this? Letâs think from the skipperâs point of view. He heads out to the ground, deploys the trawl for 5 hours, lifts and see what heâs got while deploying the next one. If the fishing is so-so, he probably wonât decide to change location until about the third haul, and he may be steaming toward a different ground anyway.<br />
Soâ¦ the skipper does three trawls at 3 knots for five hours each and in that time might have steamed 45 nautical miles from where he started. During that time we had the lights on (say). So, when we turn the lights off for the Control, what else has changed? Weâre in a different part of the ocean. Our test of light vs Control is <em>confounded</em> with Space.</p>
<p>The most intuitive way to avoid this is to <em>intersperse</em> the treatments in some way. In the simple example above, we could simply alternate lights on and off. There is an additional issue to be aware of if doing this. Letâs say the vessel does 4 tows a day, and we start each day with <em>light on</em>. What problem could this cause? In this case, the light treatment would <em>always</em> be on the pre-dawn and early afternoon tows, and the control would <em>always</em> be in the midday and evening tows. This introduces <strong>temporal confounding</strong>. Whenever there is a systematic element in the sampling program, we need to make sure we avoid any periodicity that will align with the sample program.</p>
<p>One way of safeguarding against this is to change the starting treatment for each dayâs sampling program. Statistical purists might argue for a randomized start point, but as long as the starting points are interspersed across the trip, this is sufficient to avoid confounding. So using the example above, a 4 day trip could look like:</p>

<p>For a single trawl, this is the only viable strategy to ensure interspersion. From a deployment point of view, this requires more work from the onboard observer/experimenter. Occasionally we might have to make allowances, but this spread of sampling should be the aim.</p>
<p>As we add more light treatments into a trip, the sample design becomes more complex. The same principles apply, but it is preferable to have a defined plan rather than attempting to do it on the fly. For example, letâs say we want to look at two colours. If we only had 4 days as above, what would the sample design look like?</p>

<p>Do you see what we have done here? Each Colour treatment has been applied once in each position of the Day. This is somewhat remniscent of the old-school Latin-Square sample design dating back to Fisher (1926). However there is a twist. Each treatment is alternated with a Control. This will be used in the analysis as a blocking factor to deal with the short-range spatial confounding issue, as with the first design.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Interspersion is <em>always</em> a best practice in experimental design. Note however, that as we add more lights and combinations into the mix, an extra level of complexity is introduced. If we want to look at 3 colours with 3 flash combinations, for example, we might not be able to examine them all within a trip. This is where we make decisions about whether to squeeze the whole design into a single trip, or sequentially examine particular sets within a trip. Of course this introduces a higher level (between-trip) of statisical confounding.</p>
</div>
<div class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"></p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The sample design is about addressing specific questions. There will always be some compromise and we canât let the demands of sample design âeleganceâ outshadow what we are actually trying to achieve. A series of independent answers to the right questions is more important than an elegant but inefficient grand sampling plan, that is effectively unworkable.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are two features of a single trawl design that are, quite frankly, a pain in the ass.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Interspersion of the samples in time and space requires very careful planning</p></li>
<li><p>Even with effective interspersion, there will be a considerable element of spatio-temporal variability between treatment-control pairs. The centers of the trawls could be 15 knots apart if the vessel is steaming in a straight line.</p></li>
<li><p>The design takes a long time to implement. If we have only 16 trawls available over 4 days, then we have only 8 pairs of light-on/off as out level of replication.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the vessel is a twin-rig outfit, life becomes a whole lot easier from the sample design point of view but, as we discuss later, it becomes more of an on-deck pain in the ass.</p>
